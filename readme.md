# Braadworst spring TI-84 Edition
A random game I ported to the TI-84 Graphical Calculator. Purely for fun.

## Building
Requires the [CE C Toolchain](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain) to be installed.  
Run `make gfx` and `make` in this directory. `make gfx` requires both Python3 and FFmpeg. The output file will be `/bin/BWScalc.8xp`

## License
This entire project is available under the LGPL license, not that I care much either way.
